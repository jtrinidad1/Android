This application is a simple addition game generates two randomly integers, and displays them as an addition problem in a TextView.  It also displays a message that varies depending on the value of the sum of the two integers.

The plan is to have this integrate with my other project "What Did You Say?", which is a voice input listener.  This will allow users to answer the addition problem using voice input.
