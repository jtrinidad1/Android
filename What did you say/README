This application prompts users to push a button.  Pushing the button triggers the voice recorder, at which time the user can say something (vocally).  The results of the recorded input are displayed in a List view, ordered by the confidence in accuracy.

This application was designed with the SimpleMATH application in mind.  The plan will be to merge the two applications to create a simple addition mathematics game that provides users the convenience of voice input.
